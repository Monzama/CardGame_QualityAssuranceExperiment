#Card Game QA Project
Created a game to investigate software quality assurance practices, development methods, and thorough unit testing.
Method: Focused on testing and test development, deriving user stories (US) with a test-driven development (TDD) approach. Utilized Cucumber for behavior-driven development (BDD) scenarios, Node.js for the application framework, and Selenium for end-to-end testing coverage.
Result: Gained in-depth experience in QA best practices, improved code reliability, and demonstrated effective TDD processes, leading to a robust, well-tested application.
